This repository contains three six labelled datasets on digital public health surveillance. 



## How to Access the Data

To retrive a complete tweet object including text, data, user information, and location you will need to apply for a [developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research) to access Twitter APIs.

After creating the account, install `twarc`, an API to hydrate tweetr data from TweetIDs. 

`pip install twarc`

To configure your twart requests, run the following script and enter the four credentials explained earlier.

`twarc configure`

Now you are ready to pass the files in the IDs folder to Twitter API and collect all the metadata associated with each ID.

### Rehydrate the Dataset using TweetIDs or UersIDs

To rehydrate the dataset, you can use Twarcâ€™s hydrate command can be used to rehydrate the full dataset using unique tweet identifiers. The output will be saves as a json file. Please use the Tweet_IDs folder for this purpose.  

`twarc hydrate PhysicalActivity-TweetIDs-Canada.txt > Canada_PA.jsonl`

 To only retrieve user's information (metadata), use Twarc's **user** command:
 
 `twarc users UserIDs.txt > user_meta.jsonl`
 
 #### Example

## Geospatial Data Inference
To extract the location data, we use the {place} and {full place} fields of the Twitter dataset. For each country, we need a metadata of the geographical locations to map these fields to actual city/province/state names.

To infer the location data associated with each tweet, in addition to the `place` and `full.place` fields, we use user's profile information as well as the tweet text. The example provided in the above figure illustrated the overal process of this task. Please refer to `LocationInference.ipynb` for the script.
